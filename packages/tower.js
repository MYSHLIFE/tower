/**
 * The main entry point to any Tower application.
 * Tower is split between multiple packages. This package is the one
 * you install with `npm install tower`. All other packages will be
 * installed automatically through npm as dependencies to this package.
 *
 * This package is the package manager that sets the environment up, for
 * both client-side and server-side code, and initializes the next
 * package.
 *
 * Each package has it's own tests and they are completely (for the most
 * part) independent of each other. This allows flexibility and quite a
 * bit of modularity amoung packages.
