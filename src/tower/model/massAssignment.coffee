    # Like `protected`, a role for the attributes is optional,

    # A role can be defined by using the `as` option.

    # This is the opposite of the `protected` macro:
    # Mass-assignment will only set attributes in this list,
    # to assign to the rest of attributes you can use direct writer methods.
    # This is meant to protect sensitive attributes from
    # being overwritten by malicious users tampering with URLs or forms.
    # If youâ€™d rather start from an all-open default and restrict attributes as needed,
    # have a look at {Tower.Model.MassAssigment.protected Tower.Model.protected}.
