## `dist/metro.js`

This all the code necessary to run metro in the browser.  It doesn't include server-side specific code like the mongo store and the asset pipeline stuff.  It includes:

1. Model
2. View
3. Controller
4. Route
5. Metro.Store.Memory

## `dist/metro.min.js`

The minified/obscurified version.

## Individual Files

You can also load the files individually by picking out the files you want from `dist/metro/*`.
